🛡️ TrustTrace (TT) | Collective Guardian Network
Ensuring digital accountability through collective intelligence.
TrustTrace is a proactive security ecosystem designed to protect global consumers from high-risk e-commerce entities. By transforming individual shopping experiences into "Collective Traces," the platform creates a decentralized memory of commerce trust, allowing users to verify a store's reliability before a transaction ever occurs.

👁️ The Vision
In an era of rising digital commerce fraud, TrustTrace empowers the individual to act as a Guardian for the community.

Proactive Protection: Instead of reactive complaints, TT offers real-time risk alerts and pre-submission audits to stop bad transactions before they happen.

Radical Transparency: Every delivery, partial shipment, or failure is committed to a collective feed, making it impossible for untrustworthy entities to hide.

Gamified Accountability: We turn reporting into a rewarding experience where users level up their status, from Novice to Titan Guardian, based on their contributions to the network's health.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
The project utilizes a modern, full-stack architecture designed for high-performance data synchronization and a premium 3D user experience.

Frontend
Next.js 14 (App Router): Utilizing server-side rendering and client-side transitions for a seamless, fast experience.

TypeScript: Ensuring type safety across complex data models like Trace metrics and User Dossiers.

Tailwind CSS: Powering our custom 3D glassmorphic UI and adaptive theme engine.

Axios: Handling authenticated handshakes between the Guardian client and the central intelligence server.

Backend
Node.js & Express: A robust REST API architecture designed to handle high-frequency report commits.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure, stateless authentication for Guardian identity verification.

Mongoose: Modeling complex relationships between Users and their committed Trace history.

Database
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL document store that enables the rapid scaling of the collective memory feed.

🚀 Core Modules
Intelligence Dashboard: A live feed of global traces featuring search filters, category sorting, and "High Risk Trend" detection.

Guardian Audit Engine: A real-time advice module on the report page that analyzes a URL's history while the user types.

Personal Dossier: A comprehensive command center displaying a user's Success Score, Monthly Activity, and Level Progression.
